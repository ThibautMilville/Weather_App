# Weather_App
Weather App with a connection to the API WeatherStack.


Steps to make it works :

- Create a WeatherStack account and enter your API Key in WeatherAppLogic.js
- Open the project with live server (preferably on Firefox)

If it doesn't work on Chrome, Brave or other browsers, try on Firefox : it should work on it.
